# Q1. Write a R program to create a sequence of numbers from 20 to 50 and findthe mean of
# numbers from 20 to 60 and sum of numbers from 51 to 91.

# Create a sequence of numbers from 20 to 50
sequence_20_to_50 <- 20:50
print("Sequence from 20 to 50:")
print(sequence_20_to_50)

# Calculate the mean of numbers from 20 to 60
mean_20_to_60 <- mean(20:60)
print(paste("Mean of numbers from 20 to 60:", mean_20_to_60))

# Calculate the sum of numbers from 51 to 91
sum_51_to_91 <- sum(51:91)
print(paste("Sum of numbers from 51 to 91:", sum_51_to_91))
